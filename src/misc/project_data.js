			"Built a whole C++ program from scratch in Visual Studio 2017 implementing a standard raytracer. Employed relevant mathematics to simulate reflections, lighting, and intersection detection. Raytracer supports spheres and triangles. Due to its resource-intensive nature, program is optimized both in code, via parallelization and loop optimization, and by using the Bounded Volume Heirarchy (BVH) acceleration structure.",

Successfully created a Python script that webscrapes Japanese web novels directly from ncode.syosetu.com and outputs a readable translation by making use of a Google Translation API in conjunction with user produced .dict context files.",

Worked in a team of 2 to design a single-cycle modular CPU design, datapath, and control; I synthesized the CPU in Intel's Quartus Prime and tested it in Modelsim Altera. Optimized the design for encrypting and decrypting short messages using the MIPS architecture for reference.",

If a user plays a song at a given location, time and day, and user returns to that location in the future, the player will be more likely to play that song. App implemented in Android Studio. Development in a team of 6, employing Agile development cycle principles to thoroughly plan, implement, and deliver the app. Gained working experience of full-stack organized app development, ZenHub, Google API and design patterns as well as experience with JUnit and Expresso for code and UI testing.",

Modern Chess is a 3D variation of traditional chess involving non-standard board layouts, board obstacles such as trees and rocks, and interactable items. Used 3DSMax to create certain objects and scripted a separate Python script simulating a very basic adversarial AI using the Minimax Algorithm.",
